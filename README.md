First project ever... for jul30 cohort

## Objective
Very cool little finger algorithm to multiply some numbers.

## How it works

1. Let's say I want to multiply two numbers (single digits) from 6-10
2. I use my fingers to represent each number in one hand...  with following mapping:
  thumb - 6
  index - 7
  middle - 8
  ringer - 9
  pinky - 10
  
3. Join all the fingers that reprent the 2 numbers being multiplied
4. Then count how many fingers there are joined....    X 10
5. Lastly count roaming fingers from left hand and multiply by roaming fingers in right hand.
6. Final step: add step #4 with step #5
